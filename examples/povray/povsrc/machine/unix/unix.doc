This file contains the documentation specific to UNIX systems.  Due to the
wide variety of UNIX systems available, POV-Ray may not compile directly
as is.  Every effort has been made to make it compile on as many systems as
we have access to.  If you have problems compiling, try checking with a
local UNIX guru first.  If you still have problems, contact the POV-Ray team.

If you are trying to compile POV-Ray on an unsupported platform, the UNIX
version is the best one to use as a base.


Differences from original distribution:
   The original distribution of POV-Ray is in ZIP format.  For UNIX,
   this has been converted to compressed TAR format.  In addition, the UNIX
   distribution of POV-Ray has CR-LF pairs converted to only LF's for text
   files.  Otherwise, this distribution is identical to the ZIP
   distribution.

Note: PLEASE SEE POVLEGAL.DOC.  The UNIX version in tar-compress format is an
   officially supported format and can be distributed as is.  You MAY NOT
   re-package the archive file or distribute any changes to it.  If you
   do post it on a BBS or network, you must provide at least the scene
   files and documentation files with the executables.  See POVLEGAL.DOC
   for complete details.

Executables:
   No executables are provided for the UNIX version of POV-Ray since there
   are so many possible executable formats.  In general, however, UNIX
   systems come bundled with a C compiler, so recompiling the source for
   your target system shouldn't cause a problem. You may not distribute
   an executable that you have compiled. It is for your personal use only.
   
Display Formats:
   There are two different ways to create a UNIX system.  The first way has
   no display options (i.e., it cannot display the image as it's rendering it).

   Alternatively, if you have X-Windows, you can compile in the X-Windows
   drivers.  See the section on building the source.

File Formats:
   The default file format for UNIX is "dump" format (+fd).  Targa or
   raw may be specified on the command line or in the povray.def file.

Building the source:
   POV-Ray should compile as is with most ANSI or non-ANSI UNIX compilers.
   No changes should be needed in the core of the raytracer.

   To compile POV-Ray from the original source, follow the following
   instructions:

      1) copy the files in the "source" directory into a "build" directory
      2) copy the files in machine/unix to the build directory
          (note, if your archive is in ZIP format, you probably have CR-LF
           pairs in the source code.  These should be translated to LF's
           only before you compile)
      3) rename config.h to config.h
          (This file may need to be editted on a system by system basis)

      For the non-X-Windows version:
      4) rename unix.mak to makefile

      For the X-Windows version,
      4) rename xwindows.mak to makefile

      5) Type "make"


   Your executable will be called povray.

Post-processing Images:
   POV-Ray images can be post-processed using the same utilities as DKBTrace
   used.  For UNIX systems, the PBM utilities are an excellent choice for
   post-processing utilities.  The 'dump' format of POV-Ray is the same as
   QRT format, so the QRTTOPPM utility can be used to convert these files
   to PPM format.
