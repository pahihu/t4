Height Field Targa Files By Alexander Enzmann
----------------------------------------------
Targa files can now be used for image maps, and for height fields.

For the height fields, only the red and green channels are used with red
giving the integer part of the height (from 0 to 255) and green giving the
fractional part (much like the POT file).

Enclosed is hfsomb.c and hftarga.c, an example of generating a Targa height
field along with a scene file, sombrero.pov, that uses it.
