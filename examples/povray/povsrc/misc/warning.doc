Persistence of Vision Raytracer
 Version 1.0 Caveats....
--------------------------------
This new version looks really good and stable. We've got a great program
here!  Of course, in any major program there are almost certainly 
a few little problems. Known problems and work arounds are listed below.

If you experience problems leave a message to the POV-Team in the Compuserve 
Graphics area, Raytracing forum (!GO COMART) section 16. We'll do our best 
to help you out!

Known problems:
----------------
-Not a problem, but a warning that syntax has changed. Be careful that
 you are using the new syntax correctly. Light sources in particular
 are very different.
-Bezier patch type 2 does not work with certain flatness values.
-Certain quartics, polys, blobs don't render correctly 
 when rotated or translated. Try using the "sturm" keyword.
-Often cryptic error messages. Improved a bit in this version.
-When using some compilers, the source will generate warnings during 
 compile.
 This is normal. We did not try to remove every single warning for
 every possible computer. Please report warnings only if they are
 relevant to a possible error.
