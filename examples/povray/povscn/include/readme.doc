  Persistence of Vision Raytracer Version 1.0
  -------------------------------------------

  These are the standard include files for POV-Ray. They are bundled 
  with the example scene description files.
  
  To use the POV-Ray ray tracer, you also need POVDOC.ZIP for documentation, 
  and an executable for your computer. See the file POVINFO.TXT for
  more information.

  These files should be available from the same source from where 
  you received this file.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The standard include files contain pre-defined scene elements to 
  ease the task of creating scene descriptions. The use of these files
  is explained in POVRAY.DOC and TEXTURES.DOC. The example scene files
  also show many different uses of these files. 
  
   Good luck and have fun ray tracing!
