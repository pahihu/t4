General
=======

This (free) program emulates a combination of an Inmos T414 transputer (with 2M RAM) and the standard iserver host interface program.

The emulator runs single transputer binaries as though invoked using "iserver -se -sb bootfile.btl". The "-se" stop-on-error flag may be turned off using the options menu. The other options menu entry allows you to enable instruction profiling, which counts how many instructions of each kind are executed and saves the result to a file called "profile".

Bug reports are welcome. My email address is J.C.Highfield@lut.ac.uk, however this will change shortly. Bug reports should take the form of a summary of the machine the emulator is being run on, the compiler the transputer binary was generated by and whatever the binary does. Since bugs in an emulator can take a long time to track down, with some recent ones appearing after the emulator had executed 100 million instructions, then to actually solve a bug report I would probably need the binary and any data files it uses. Arithmetic bugs etc. would however be much simpler to solve than this, with a one line example program being quite adequate.

Precompiled Macintosh version
=============================

This runs on both 68k and PowerPC based Macintoshes. It needs 2.5 MBytes of memory. It has been tested on a PowerMac 6100, a IIci, an LCII, a quadra 650 and a powerbook 165.

Source-code version
===================

The source should compile on Macintoshes (I use CodeWarrior) and most unixes. I have compiled and tested it under the following unix / unix-like systems with no problems: NetBSD 1.1, SunOS 4.1.4, SGI Irix 5.2. I also compiled it under HP-UX 8 or 9, but that required some tweaking of the source. Read the Makefile for more hints.

A "Hello World" transputer binary is included as an example for testing the emulator.
