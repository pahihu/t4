   Non-commercial distribution is classified as a user
   copying the software for a personal friend or colleague
   and not charging money or services for that copy. This does
   not include non-profit organizations. These groups should use
   the Shareware/Freeware distribution company rules below.
   
   This method of distribution is encouraged as long as the archives
   are distributed complete and unmodified. We also ask that
   the user copy the executable archives, documentation archives, and
   sample scene file archives together for the friend or colleague.
   We consider this the full package for normal use.

   If the source archive is copied, we ask that the user also include
   the documentation archive.

   Conditions for SHAREWARE/FREEWARE distribution companies
   --------------------------------------------------------------
   Shareware and freeware distribution companies may distribute the 
   archives under the conditions following this paragraph. This privilege

   that distribution stop.

   The archive containing the executable, the archive containing the 
   documentation, and the archive containing sample scenes must be 
   distributed together by shareware/freeware distribution companies.

   They must provide the excutable archive, documentation archive and 
   sample scene file archive as one package. The company may not put
   each archive on a separate disk and charge for three disks if all 
   three archives will fit on one disk. If more than one disk is needed
   to store the archives then more than one disk may be used and charged
   for.

   The distributor is not required to make the source archive available 
   with the other archives. But if the distributor does choose to make
