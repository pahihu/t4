                  Persistence of Vision Raytracer
                          Version 1.0 
                        Basic Information
                  -------------------------------
    
    The Persistence of Vision Raytracer creates three-dimensional,
photo-realistic images using a rendering technique called ray tracing.
It reads in a text file containing information describing the objects and
lighting in a scene and generates an image of that scene from the view
point of a camera also described in the text file. Ray tracing is not
a fast process by any means, but it produces very high quality images
with realistic reflections, shading, perspective, and other effects.

   The POV-Ray package includes detailed instructions on using the
raytracer and creating scenes. Many stunning scenes are included with
POV-Ray so you can start creating images immediately when you get
the package. These scenes can be modified by the user also so they
don't have to start from scratch.

   In addition to the pre-defined scenes are a large library of
predefined shapes and materials that can be used in your own scenes by
just typing the name of the shape or material.

   POV-Ray is easy to use, and also includes many advanced features
like bezier patches, blobs, height-fields, bump mapping, and material
mapping.

   POV-Ray can be used on IBM-PC and compatibles, Apple Macintoshes,
Commodore Amiga's, UNIX, and other computers.

   Here is a list the files that you need to use POV-Ray on your 
computer. 

The latest versions of these files are available over CompuServe, 
America Online, Internet, and several BBS's. See 'Where to find POV-Ray 
files' section below for more info.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                
     For IBM-PC & compatibles:
     -------------------------      
        Requires: 386 or better CPU and at least 2 meg of RAM
                  A math co-processor and VGA display is recommended
                  This version will run under DOS, OS/2 and Windows.
                  It will not run under Desqview.
        
        Files required:
        POVDOC.ZIP - The documentation for POV-Ray
        POVSCN.ZIP - The example scene files for POV-Ray
        POVIBM.ZIP - Executable and docs for IBM-PC and compatibles
        
        You will also need a program like PICLAB or Image Alchemy to convert
        the TGA files output by POV-Ray to GIF files and a GIF viewer
        program. These programs can be found from any of the sources 
        listed below.  
        
        Optional Files:
        The source is not needed to use POV-Ray. It is provided for the
        curious and adventurous
        
        POVSRC.ZIP - The C source code for POV-Ray
        
        
     For Apple Macintosh:
     --------------------
        Requires: 68020 or better CPU, 32 bit Color Quickdraw, and
                  a math co-processor or software emulation of a 
                  math co-processor.
       
                  The math co-processor emulator is needed on the Mac LC 
                  and Powerbook 140. The documentation included with the 
                  executable describes where to find a math co-processor 
                  emulator.
       
                  32 bit Color Quickdraw is part of System 7's automatic 
                  installation on color Macs. Owners of Mac SE/30 and 
                  other non-color Macs will need to use custom 
                  installation options to add 32 bit Color Quickdraw.

   In the POVDOC archive is the file POVRAY.DOC which contains details 
on installing and using POV-Ray. Specific instructions for
using POV-Ray with your computer are included with the executable.

   The POV-Team is a collection of volunteer programmers, designers,
animators and artists meeting via electronic mail on Compuserve's
COMART forum, section 16 Raytracing (COMART is also the home of the
very popular Fractint and its authors the Stone Soup Group.)

   The POV-Team's goal is to create freely distributable, high
quality rendering and animation software written in C that can be
easily ported to many different computers.
