This file contains the documentation specific to the VAX/VMS version of
POV-Ray.

Differences from original distribution:
   The original distribution of POV-Ray is in ZIP format.  For VMS,
   this has been converted to a backup save set.  In addition, the VMS
   distribution of POV-Ray has CR-LF pairs converted to only CR's for text
   files.  Otherwise, the VAX/VMS distribution is identical to the ZIP
   distribution.

Note: PLEASE SEE POVLEGAL.DOC.  The VMS version in backup format is an
   officially supported format and can be distributed as is.  You MAY NOT
   re-package the archive file or distribute any changes to it.  If you
   do post it on a BBS or network, you must provide at least the data
   files and documentation files with the executables.  See POVLEGAL.DOC
   for complete details.

Executables:

   Both object and executable files are provided.  They have been compiled
   and linked under VMS 5.3-1.  The executable is called POVRAY.EXE.
   
Running POV-Ray:
   Assign a foreign symbol to the executable.  The syntax is:
      povray :== $<your_disk>:[<directory>]povray
   An example symbol might look like:
      povray :== $dua100:[povray.build]povray

   When running POV-Ray, be sure that you have a large working set.

File Formats:
   The default file format for the Amiga is "dump" format (+fd).  Targa or
   raw may be specified on the command line or in the povray.def file.

Building the source:
   POV-Ray was compiled using VAX C version 3.1.  I'm sure that later
   versions will also work fine.  If you're compiling with another compiler,
   you may have to edit the build procedure to set the proper compiler
   options.  As far as that goes, you're on your own.

   To compile POV-Ray from the original source, follow the following
   instructions:

      1) copy the files in the "source" directory into a "build" directory
      2) copy the files in [.source.machine.vms] to the build directory
      3) rename vaxconf.h to config.h
      4) execute "@vaxbuild"

Post-processing Images:
   POV-Ray images can be post-processed using the PBMPLUS utilities.

Diplaying Images:
   There are many utilities available for displaying POV-Ray files.  For 
   myself, I usually convert them to PBMPLUS format and use the xloadimage
   utility.  I have heard that the xv utility may be able to display 
   QRT/DKBtrace files (which is what these are) directly.  Both xv and 
   xloadimage are available via FTP from Black.Cerritos.Edu and 
   White.Cerritos.Edu.  There is also a mail server available via 
   MAILSERV@Cerritos.edu.  Place the one line command 'help' in the body of
   the message for more information.

   For those with a Postscipt printer, you can use PBMPLUS to convert POV-Ray
   files to Postscript and then print them.

Questions and problems in the VAX/VMS version can be directed to the Usenet 
group COMP.GRAPHICS.
