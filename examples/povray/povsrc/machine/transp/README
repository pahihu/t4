Dear transputer user,

This directory contains all file files for the transputerversion of
POV-Ray1.0. This is a special version of this software and is not
supported by the POV-Team!! Any question and bug reports of the
transputerversion should be send to me (menes@statistik.tu-muenchen.de)!!
I will trace down the problems and contact the POV-Team if the bug is in
there sourcecode. Thanks for your cooperation.

Basics

0. This is source only distrubution so you need the INMOS TOOLSET ANSI-C
compiler. If not please contact me. May be i will be able to give you an
executable of the transputer POVRay.

1. What kind of transputer system do I need to run POV?

Every transputer system with a minimum of 4 and a maximum ??? T8XX transputer could be used.
The memory one cache transputer (t0) should be 4 MBytes the other could run with 1
Mbyte, but default is also 4 MByte. But for some scenes you will need more the 4 MByte of ram 
on each transputer.

2. How to connect the links of the transputer to match the configuration
file?

The hardware configuration for 10 transputer should look like this.


			
			t3	t6	t9 
			|	|	|
			t2	t5	t8
			|	|	|
			t1	t4	t7
			|	|	|
			--------t0-------
 				|
			       HOST

/* connection to the host */
connect HOST to t0 link0
/* PIPE 0 */
connect t0 link1 to t1 link0
connect t1 link1 to t2 link0
connect t2 link1 to t3 link0
/* PIPE 1 */
connect t0 link2 to t4 link0
connect t4 link1 to t5 link0
connect t5 link1 to t6 link0
/* PIPE 2 */
connect t0 link3 to t7 link0
connect t7 link1 to t8 link0
connect t8 link1 to t9 link0

The povray.cfs (the configuration file) has by default this hardware
configuration. If you want to change it because you have more transputer
than 10 or less no problem. Edit povray.cfs with your editor. In the first
lines you will find three values PIPE0, PIPE1, PIPE2. Every PIPE can have
values from 1 transputer to any number of transputer you like. They also can
be of differnt size. But you will get the best performence if you distribute
the transputer equally to the PIPE's.

3. How to configure differnt RAM sizes?

Some lines below the PIPE values you see a comment 
/*{{{ Hardware description }}} */. After that you could change the memory 
values for your transputer system.

For example you have 16 MByte of ram for each transputer in the PIPE's and
the cache transputer than the lines should look like this:

T800 (memory = 16M) Root;
T800 (memory = 16M) WorkerPipe0[PIPE0];
T800 (memory = 16M) WorkerPipe1[PIPE1];
T800 (memory = 16M) WorkerPipe2[PIPE2];

4. What should i do if i have an other architecture of transputernetwork?

Than you have to change at minimum the configuration file povray.cfs. Most
problems will araise if you aren't able to connect link0 of transputer t0 to
the host, or the pipe connection are not link0 and link1. This is easy to
fix. Right below the PIPE values you can change the values of the hardware
link connections for BootLink, the link values from transputer t0 to the 3
PIPES and the in and out link of the Pipes. If this doesn't fit your needs
than a lot of work to change the configuration file is laying a head.

Installation:

1. Try to get the sources of POV-Ray1.0 from alfred.ccs.carleton.ca
(134.117.1.1) (for US based users) or ftp.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de
(134.106.1.9) (for europa based users) via ftp. These are the two official
sites for POV related stuff. Also a bunch of utilitys can be found on these
sites.

2. Make a directory in the toolset path for POV-Ray. Put all *.tar.Z files
in it and extract them. After that you will have 3 dirs (povdoc, povscn,
povsrc). Go to povsrc/ and make a dir called build. Now copy all files
from the source dir to the build dir. After that change to machine dir.
Create a dir call transp (home of the transputer sources). Copy the
transp.tar.Z in that directory. Extract all files from the tar file and copy
all file to the ../../build dir. Now change again to ../../build and rename
the file transconf.h to config.h. After that type make -f povray.mak. (Be
sure to have all paths and env variables set correct for compiling with the
INMOS toolset befor you start with make). Now the compiler will build your
version of POV-Ray. Don't worry about the tones of warnings during
compilation this is normal!! 

If some thing doesn't work please try to find the real reason for your problems 
befor you conntact me. I couldn't help you if you only send me a mail like this: 

Oh Rainer,
 
the POV-Ray would compile what should i do?  

Help!!

Running:

1. There some shell scripts in the build dir witch are intended for unix
systems. To run all povdemos just type povdemo if your are on a unix
machine. If not it should be easy to convert it to a for example to batch
files for MSDOS. If you have problems with it send me mail.

Options:

1. Normaly the makefile for POV-Ray will give you file support
(-dFILE_SUPPORT) for the traced images. After you have finshed your 
trace there is a file with the name picture.ppm in the working directory. 
A ppm file is a RGB file format
from pbmplus3.0 graphics utilities. If you dont know were to get try
wuarchive.wustl.edu in the dirs /usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume23 or for
PC users /usenet/comp.binaries.ibm.pc/volume15. If you are running X11 on
your machine the application XV2.21 is able to read display and convert the
ppm files.

2. If you have one transputer with a truecolor graphic hardware like i do,
than enable the option -dG300_SUPPORT in the makefile, and change in the
muxdemux.c file in the first line the addresse of the video buffer
(VRAM_BASE) to your hardware addresse. 

To initialize the graphic display you should run a init
of your own for the graphiccard as seperate program. Also the witdh on hight
of the display is defined in the values MAXX and MAXY below VRAM_BASE.

Bugs:

1. Antialising doesn't run. I didn't had time to trace down the problem, but
if you want to help me a bit try to find the mistake.

2. The maximal resolution is 640x480, because of a static definition in
muxdemux.c (MAXX and MAXY). This will change in in the near future.


Development:

1. Support of a newer version of POV-Ray if it is out.
2. ....??? (mail me and give me idears)

Performace:

	machine		       min   sec
SGI indigo R3000+R3100  	5  : 31
SGI crimpson R4000+R4100 	3  : 14
11 Transputer (T805 20MHz)	4  : 35
43 Transputer (T805 20 MHz)	1  : 14

Performence increse per transputer is up to 95% off the maximal possible
improfment. (depends on the scenes files use for benchmarking)

Now have fun with this software and happy tracing.
